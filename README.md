# Heart-Failure-Patient-Analytics-Dashboard
**ðŸ“Œ Overview**  
This project presents an interactive healthcare analytics dashboard built in Power BI, using the Kaggle Heart Failure Clinical Records dataset. The dashboard provides insights into patient demographics, mortality trends, and clinical risk factors, helping identify patterns that could assist in targeted interventions.  
  
**ðŸ›  Tools & Technologies**  
Power BI â€“ Data modeling, visualization, dashboard design    
DAX â€“ KPI calculations, risk score logic   
Power Query â€“ Data cleaning & transformation  
  
**ðŸ“Š Dashboard Features**  
**KPIs:**  
Average Age  
Total Patients  
% Death Events  
% High Risk Patients  
  
**Visuals:**  
Stacked Bar Chart â€“ Age Group vs Death Events  
Donut Chart â€“ Death Event Distribution  
Stacked Column Chart â€“ Death Events by High Blood Pressure  
Line Chart â€“ Ejection Fraction trends by Age Group  
  
**Data Preparation:**  
Age Group classification  
Risk Level categorization based on Ejection Fraction and Serum Creatinine  
Death Event percentage

**ðŸ“ˆ Key Insights**  
Higher mortality rate observed in older age groups   
High blood pressure correlates with increased death events  
Ejection fraction tends to decrease with age, indicating higher cardiac risk
